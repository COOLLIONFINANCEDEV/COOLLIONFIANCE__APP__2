          </Typography>
          <Typography sx={{ fontSize: "1.2rem",   textAlign: { xs: "center", md: "justify" }, }}>
            This loan is administered by Friendship Bridge (FB), a nonprofit,
            nongovernmental organization that empowers thousands of impoverished
            Guatemalan women through its Microcredit Plus program. The program
            combines small loans averaging US$350 for four-to-twelve month loan
            terms with non-formal, participatory education. As FB clients, women
            start, expand, or diversify their businesses and learn practical
            lessons on topics including business, health, and self-esteem. FBâ€™s
            clients borrow as a group, forming Trust Banks (groups of 7-25 women
            who serve as co-guarantors of the loan and act as a self-regulating
            support network).
